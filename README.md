# Healthcare-Cost-Analysis-Using-ML



Project Description:
The "Healthcare Cost Analysis Using Machine Learning" project is a data-driven exploration aimed at understanding and predicting healthcare costs based on a set of key features. The features include AGE (age of the patient), FEMALE (gender), LOS (length of hospital stay), RACE, TOTCHG (total charges), and APRDRG (All Patient Refined Diagnosis-Related Group).

Through the utilization of advanced machine learning algorithms, this project seeks to discern patterns and relationships within healthcare data that influence the overall cost of medical services. By analyzing the impact of demographic factors, length of hospitalization, diagnosis-related groups, and other relevant variables, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the drivers of healthcare expenses.

The predictive modeling aspect of the project will enable healthcare providers, policymakers, and analysts to anticipate and understand the potential costs associated with patient care. This, in turn, can aid in resource allocation, financial planning, and the development of strategies to optimize the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of healthcare services.

In summary, the "Healthcare Cost Analysis Using Machine Learning" project endeavors to leverage machine learning techniques to enhance our understanding of the factors influencing healthcare costs, ultimately contributing to more informed decision-making in the healthcare sector.
