# Healthcare-Cost-Analysis-Using-ML



Project Description:
The "Healthcare Cost Analysis Using Machine Learning" project is a data-driven exploration aimed at understanding and predicting healthcare costs based on a set of key features. The features include AGE (age of the patient), FEMALE (gender), LOS (length of hospital stay), RACE, TOTCHG (total charges), and APRDRG (All Patient Refined Diagnosis-Related Group).

Through the utilization of advanced machine learning algorithms, this project seeks to discern patterns and relationships within healthcare data that influence the overall cost of medical services. By analyzing the impact of demographic factors, length of hospitalization, diagnosis-related groups, and other relevant variables, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the drivers of healthcare expenses.
